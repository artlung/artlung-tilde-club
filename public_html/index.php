<P>Welcome to my Tilde Club WWW space! My name is Joe and I have been using the World-Wide Web since 1994 and making pages on it since 1996 and I really like it.</P>

<P> The World-Wide Web is a hypertext-based, distributed
            information system created by researchers at CERN in
            Switzerland. <I>See also <A href="http://www.w3.org">

                It's been more than a month since my last update! Missed March entirely due to how busy I was! But I've made so many things since then!

                <A HREF="https://artlung.com/cssbattles/">CSS Battle Progress</A> is at 94%. 343 Videos about 635 Daily Targets on <A HREF="https://cssbattle.dev/">CSS Battle.dev</A>. 3 dozen to go. And a new one rolling out daily.

                I am mirroring my <A HREF="https://artlung.com/indieweb/">Profile page from indieweb.org</A> as well as the <A HREF="https://artlung.com/front-end-study-hall/">Front End Study Hall</A> page. The latter picks up the webmentions sent to it. And FrESH celebrated a one year anniversary and I wrote about it
                <A HREF="https://artlung.com/blog/2025/04/25/study-hall-reflections/">Study Hall Reflections</A>. I'm quite proud that I've put the effort to continue the event and folks enjoy it.

                The Front Page of <A HREF="https://artlung.com/">ARTLUNG.COM</A> is no longer under WordPress and it has been fun choosing and playing with tuning what's on it and pulling in content via RSS.

                I revamped two websites. Both started years ago as pages on artlung.com and made their way to subdomains.
                There, I could ignore them. And this year, they have been exhumed and polished up! And so:
                <a href="https://smorgasborg.artlung.com">Smorgasborg</a> is a collection of random stuff. It's not on GitHub. And <a href="https://lab.artlung.com">THE LAB</a>
                is also a collection of random stuff, with a more programming, especially <I>web programming</I> focus.
                It <I><a href="https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com/">is on GitHub</a></I>

                I started making videos of myself haphazardly doing the daily CSS Battle.

  <DT>June 2024</DT>
  <DD><A href="https://indieweb.org/Front_End_Study_Hall">FrESH</A> is ongoing and fun to host. I've learned a lot.</DD>
  <DD>I will be going to San Diego Comic-Con in July. And I'll be going to <A href="https://artlung.com/blog/tag/xoxofest/">XOXO Festival</A> in Portland in August. That's nifty.</DD>
  <DT>May 2024</DT>
  <DD>I took over maintenance of <A href="https://blogofthe.day">blogofthe.day</A></DD>
  <DD>I added to my <A href="https://github.com/artlung">github profile</A></DD>
  <DD>Since my last update the first and a second <A href="https://indieweb.org/Front_End_Study_Hall">Front End Study Hall</A> were run. They were both great. And another is upcoming! I created a <A href="https://artlung.com/headers/-20240511">new header</A>. The water in the ocean is getting a bit warmer too. Life is pretty good.</DD>
  <DT>April 2024</DT>
  <DD>I have a new gig I'm enjoying. And I'll be doing a learning and teaching <A href="https://artlung.com/blog/2024/04/15/front-end-study-hall/">event I call "Front End Study Hall"</A> this month and I hope it'll be fun and useful.</DD>

    February 2024:
<DD><A href="https://artlung.com/blog/2024/02/21/tilde-club/">I wrote about updating this page</A> over on my other website.
  <DD>
    I added a "Lincoln Baio." I think that's what people are saying when they say that.
    <DD>I added a tiny style sheet.
    </DD>
    <DT>2014:
    <DD>It's fun to make little web pages.

<HR>

<H2>About This Site</h2>
<DL>
    <DT>Why does this page look old?
  <DD>It's written in HTML 2.0, an older spec. HTML 2.0 was created in 1995 (<A href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">RFC 1866</A>). It works just fine. The great thing about conforming to an HTML standard is that it's likely to keep working in decades later.
  <DD>HTML 2.0 referred to style sheets being linkable in LINK tags: <I>"<CODE>&lt;LINK&gt;</CODE> hyperlinks may also be processed without explicit user request; for example, style sheet resources may be processed before or during the processing of the document."</I>
  <DD>It would be another year before a browser shipped CSS.
    <DD>
        <I>Fun fact:</I> In HTML 2.0, the allowed attributes of the <CODE>&lt;IMG&gt;</CODE> tag are only <CODE>ALIGN</CODE>, <CODE>ALT</CODE>, <CODE>ISMAP</CODE>, and <CODE>SRC</CODE>.
    </DD>
  <DD>HTML 2 was superseded in 1997 by <A href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/SPSD-html32-20180315/">HTML 3.2</A>. Also now superseded.
