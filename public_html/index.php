<P>Welcome to my Tilde Club WWW space! My name is Joe and I have been using the World-Wide Web since 1994 and making pages on it since 1996 and I really like it.</P>

<P> The World-Wide Web is a hypertext-based, distributed
            information system created by researchers at CERN in
            Switzerland. <I>See also <A href="http://www.w3.org">

  <DD>Since my last update the first and a second <A href="https://indieweb.org/Front_End_Study_Hall">Front End Study Hall</A> were run. They were both great. And another is upcoming! I created a <A href="https://artlung.com/headers/-20240511">new header</A>. The water in the ocean is getting a bit warmer too. Life is pretty good.</DD>

    February 2024:
<DD><A href="https://artlung.com/blog/2024/02/21/tilde-club/">I wrote about updating this page</A> over on my other website.
  <DD>
    I added a "Lincoln Baio." I think that's what people are saying when they say that.
    <DD>I added a tiny style sheet.
    </DD>
    <DT>2014:
    <DD>It's fun to make little web pages.

<H2>About This Site</h2>
<DL>
    <DT>Why does this page look old?
  <DD>It's written in HTML 2.0, an older spec. HTML 2.0 was created in 1995 (<A href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">RFC 1866</A>). It works just fine. The great thing about conforming to an HTML standard is that it's likely to keep working in decades later.
  <DD>HTML 2.0 referred to style sheets being linkable in LINK tags: <I>"<CODE>&lt;LINK&gt;</CODE> hyperlinks may also be processed without explicit user request; for example, style sheet resources may be processed before or during the processing of the document."</I>
  <DD>It would be another year before a browser shipped CSS.
    <DD>
        <I>Fun fact:</I> In HTML 2.0, the allowed attributes of the <CODE>&lt;IMG&gt;</CODE> tag are only <CODE>ALIGN</CODE>, <CODE>ALT</CODE>, <CODE>ISMAP</CODE>, and <CODE>SRC</CODE>.
    </DD>
  <DD>HTML 2 was superseded in 1997 by <A href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/SPSD-html32-20180315/">HTML 3.2</A>. Also now superseded.
